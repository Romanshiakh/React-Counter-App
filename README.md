# Counter App

A simple counter component built with React using the `useState` hook. The component allows users to increment, decrement, and reset the counter value. It is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Create a new React project if you don't have one already:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-counter-app
   cd my-counter-app
Install Tailwind CSS:

bash
npm install tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
Configure Tailwind CSS by adding the following to your tailwind.config.js:

javascript
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Add Tailwind CSS to your src/index.css:

css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Usage
Copy the Counter component code and save it in a file named Counter.js inside the src folder of your project.

Import and use the Counter component in your src/App.js:

javascript
import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Run your React application:

bash
npm start
